CRABEX – Secure Data Wiping & Verification System

CRABEX is a secure, standards-aware data wiping system designed to permanently erase sensitive data from storage devices and prevent data leakage during device reuse and recycling.
The project also includes a scope-restricted AI chatbot to explain data wiping concepts and guide users.

📌 Problem Statement

Electronic waste (e-waste) is growing rapidly due to frequent device replacement.
A major reason devices are discarded instead of reused is the fear of sensitive data leakage.

Normal delete or reset does not remove data permanently

Recoverable data leads to privacy breaches and identity theft

Organizations destroy usable devices to avoid risk, increasing e-waste

CRABEX addresses this trust gap by providing verifiable and irreversible data wiping.

🎯 Objectives

Permanently erase data from storage devices

Prevent data recovery after device disposal or reuse

Align with data sanitization standards (NIST SP 800-88)

Provide verification and audit logs

Educate users through an AI chatbot
